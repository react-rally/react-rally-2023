From static HTML files to dynamic server-generated HTML responses. Then to REST or GraphQL APIs consumed by JavaScript-heavy clients with the Jamstack. The web is entering a completely new transformation. Modern infrastructure and techniques have changed the rules of what it means to make an excellent user experience. In this new future, what's old is new and what's modern is lacking."

Enter WebAssembly!\n\nThis talk shares how to achieve Server-side rendering using WebAssembly and WASMEdge which is a WebAssembly Runtime. The talk also covers the benefits of using WebAssembly to achieve Server Side Rendering. The talk will also cover a demo of how to launch a React application using the WasmEdge runtime."

Excelling at any of these \"soft\" skills could mean taking courses to learn more about the tools, asking a mentor to guide you when you feel overwhelmed, and engaging in a ton of trial and error when it matters the most.\n\nSoft skills are competencies. We must consistently and actively work at developing these abilities so we can be successful teammates, managers, leaders and coworkers. And there's one skill above all that can get you there faster: empathy."

Well, it’s because we think about performance as an afterthought after it becomes a bottleneck and when our infra gets costly, ouch!\n\nBut there is a way to solve this, introducing Core React. We won’t be introducing new tools but going back to how we need to tell React what the DOM should look like. In this talk, we will finally understand why useCallback and useMemo are used, why lighthouse doesn’t represent performance, why React re-renders? and lastly how to profile it with React Devtools."

We’re already starting to see how more tools, and more education, lead to more innovation and a future where open, cheap LLMs will be available to everyone.\n\nIn this talk, we’ll walk through the process of harnessing an LLM’s imagination and empowering it with knowledge and tools from the real world to perform one of the most delicate human tasks: creating mixtapes.\n\nWe’ll discover the subtle nuances of Prompt Engineering, learn how to manage and manipulate a chatbot’s memory, dig into the complexities of ChatGPT's response time and Vercel's Edge Functions with Next.js, and discuss some open source tools that we can leverage with existing and future LLMs as we explore this new frontier."

At their worst, defaults ship hundreds of wasted JS kilobytes for routing, state, and other baggage developers may never use. But at their best, defaults give us a simple baseline to start from, with a clear path to add the exact set of features our project demands. This is the magic of opt-in design.\n\nLet's see how smart defaults guide modern frontend tools from Astro to React Server Components, and why this new era reshapes your workflow, and website performance metrics, for the better."

Way before Bootstrap we all had our own small CSS snippets copied from project to project with similar classes.\n\nHowever, there are good reasons why we stopped doing that for a while and we should discuss them before using them everywhere.\n\nIn this session, we'll discuss the evolution of scalable CSS, walk through the limitations and drawbacks of Atomic CSS, and also figure out where this concept can come in handy."
