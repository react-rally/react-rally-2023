          <h2>Full Stack Foundations</h2>

          <p>
            You're busy shipping software,<br/><br/>
            You've got tons of responsibility.<br/><br/>
            Solving problems with the simplest, most optimal pattern is absolutely one of them.<br/><br/>
            Shipping quickly is another.<br/><br/>
            In your rush to get things out the door, you can often skip over many important foundational concepts that would simplify your life a great deal without even knowing it. Even if you've been doing this for a long time, keeping up with advancements in software development is challenging (I promise, you don't have to use <code>display: table</code> to vertically center divs anymore üò©).<br/><br/>
            This workshop will fill gaps in your knowledge you didn't even know you had and update your mental models for the NOW!<br/><br/>
            In the time we go through this together, we'll cover modern best practices across the stack:<br/>
            <ul>
              <li>Styling</li>
              <li>Routing</li>
              <li>Loading & Mutating Data</li>
              <li>Client-side Scripting</li>
            </ul>
            We'll cover a lot of ground, giving you a solid foundation for everything else you do on the web. ‚ö°Ô∏è
